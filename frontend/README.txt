example.html is the example writting during workshop 1 I'd advise ignoring it, but putting it up just incase someone from workshop 1 wants it

Example2.html is the more complete example which was done during workshop 3 this is what I'd reference to when trying to experiment!!!!!

simplefrontpage.html was my reference materials while teaching the workshops, just incase anyone wants to see that as well.
